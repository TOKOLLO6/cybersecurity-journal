# Week 1: Kicking Off My Cybersecurity Journey 🚀

Hi everyone! I'm currently a software development student based in South Africa, and this month I'm diving into the world of cybersecurity during my study recess. Here's a breakdown of my first week — the start of what I hope becomes a long-term journey in the cyber world.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

### ✅ Setting Up Tools
- Created accounts on:
  - TryHackMe
  - Hack The Box
  - GitHub
- Decided to use **TryHackMe’s AttackBox** for easy access to Linux tools and hacking environments.

### 🌐 Networking Basics
- Learned about IP addresses, DNS, TCP/UDP protocols.
- Understood the role of ports, the OSI model, and how data flows through networks.
- Compared TCP vs UDP:
  - **TCP:** Reliable, connection-based (used for things like web browsing and emails).
  - **UDP:** Faster, connectionless (used for streaming, games).

### 🐧 Linux Fundamentals
- Completed the TryHackMe **Linux Fundamentals Part 1** room.
- Practiced commands like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `cat`, and `nano`.
- Explored the Linux file structure and basic permissions.

### 🔒 Firewalls, VPNs, and Proxies
- Watched YouTube videos to understand:
  - **Firewalls:** Block or allow traffic based on rules.
  - **VPNs:** Encrypt your internet connection and mask your IP address.
  - **Proxies:** Route your traffic through a server to hide your real identity or bypass restrictions.

## 🔧 Tools I’ve Been Using
- **TryHackMe AttackBox**
- YouTube for quick theory refreshers
- Markdown + GitHub for documenting

## 💬 Reflections
This first week has been a mix of reviewing what I already knew and discovering new concepts. I really enjoyed the hands-on labs — it’s one thing to learn theory, but seeing it work in a simulated environment makes it stick.

Next up: diving into more Linux commands, web hacking, and starting to understand how real-world attacks are built.

## 📅 Weekly Goals Going Forward
- Practice web hacking tools like Burp Suite
- Begin Hack The Box Starting Point labs
- Start journaling my journey weekly
